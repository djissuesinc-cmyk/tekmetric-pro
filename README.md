# Tekmetric Pro

You are looking at **Tekmetric Pro**. This is a custom, unofficial browser extension and workflow automation tool. Let me be perfectly clear. I do not work for Tekmetric. I have no affiliation with them. I built this outside their knowledge. This software is provided entirely "as is." You install it, and you accept the risks. 

## What It Does

Tekmetric Pro forces the standard web app to behave better. It runs completely locally in your browser. It does not touch Tekmetric servers.

Here is a breakdown of the modifications:

| Feature Category | Specific Functions |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Visuals** | Dark mode for low-light environments. |
| | Calendar appointments get an 'X' through the box when marked done. |
| | Other minor UI tweaks. |
| **Typing & Text** | Spell check. |
| | Auto-capitalization after you finish typing. |
| **AI Integration** | Google Gemini integration. |
| | AI comment generation and tweaking. |
| | Local AI diagnostic assistance. |
| **Workflow** | Auto-login functionality. |
| | Auto-updates for this custom app. |

## Privacy and Security

You might worry about data leaks. Stop stressing. 

* This script runs 100% on the host PC within your browser.
* No outside information goes anywhere, except calls to the Gemini API.
* Everything clears the second you close the app.
* This does not break the actual Tekmetric service.

## Installation

You need to understand what you are doing before you run this. 

1. Get your Google Gemini API key ready.
2. Install the script in your browser.
3. Enter your credentials for auto-login and your API key.
4. Start using the modified interface.
